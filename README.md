## UPenn thesis skeleton
### Antal Spector-Zabusky

A LaTeX skeleton for a well-formatted UPenn PhD thesis, pulled from my CS thesis
submitted in Spring 2021.  Feel free to use it for anything and to contact me
with any questions about it.  I can't promise it's perfect, but hey, they
accepted my thesis!
