So far I've introduced the theory of validating synchronous interactions using
the QAC language family, and shown how to construct validators by dualization
with a simple $\Prog$ language.

However, in real-world testing practices, there are more problems to consider.
For example: How to interact with the SUT via multiple channels?  How to handle
external nondeterminism?

As discussed in \autoref{sec:intro-external-nondet}, a networked server's
response may be delayed by the network environment, and an asynchronous tester
may send other requests rather than waiting for the response.  Therefore, we
cannot view the trace as a sequence of $Q\times A$ pairs like we did
in \autoref{def:trace-validity}, and the state monad in the QAC language family
becomes insufficient for defining the space of asynchronous interactions.

This chapter applies the idea of dualization to testing asynchronous systems.  I
transition from the QAC language family to the ITree specification language, a
data structure for modelling programs' asynchronous interactions in the Coq
proof assistant.  ITree provides more expressiveness than QAC, and allows
specifying the external nondeterminism caused by the network environment.  The
ITree-based specifications are derived into tester programs that can interact
with the SUT and reveal potential defects.

\autoref{fig:framework} illustrates the derivation framework from ITrees to
testers.  \autoref{sec:itree} introduces the ITree language that encodes each
box in the framework.  \autoref{sec:internal-nondet} and
\autoref{sec:external-nondet} address internal and external nondeterminism in
the ITree context, and interprets the ``server model'' into a ``nondeterministic
tester''.  \autoref{sec:backtrack} then explains how to execute the
nondterministic tester model as an interactive tester program that runs on
deterministic machines.
