In \autoref{chap:theory}, I introduced the theory of validators using the QAC
language family.  I also shown how to prove validators' correctness with a
simple $\Prog$ language.

However, in real-world testing practices, there are more problems to consider.
For example: How to interact with the SUT via multiple channels?  How to handle
external nondeterminism?

This chapter describes how to derive specifications into tester programs that
can interact with the SUT and reveal potential defects, using \http as an
example.  The derivation framework is shown in outline in
\autoref{fig:framework}.  Each box is a model program, and the arrows are
``interpretors'' that transform one model into another.

\autoref{sec:itree} introduces the ITree modelling language for specifying
protocols and deriving them into testers.  \autoref{sec:external-nondet} and
\autoref{sec:internal-nondet} address external and internal nondeterminism in
the ITree context.  \autoref{sec:backtrack} explains how to execute the derived
tester model as an interactive program.
